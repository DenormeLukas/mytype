        As said, I designed that, not bad right?
      </p>

      <p>
        I always was a <span class="medium">very conservative person</span> so it’s only right that I designed
        <span class="medium">one of the most progressive fonts</span> during my time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Futura is representative of the Bauhaus ideology, <span class="medium">function over form</span>f even though I
        wasn’t involved in Bauhaus.
      </p>

      <p>
        It <span class="medium">took me 3 years</span> to finish the font.
        I started sketching in 1924 and it was <span class="medium">released in 1927.</span>
        Took me quite a while.
        <span class="light-italic">I wanted it to be perfect.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        It had to have everything it needed.
        <p class="light-italic">No more, no less.</p>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can see this in the anatomy of the font.

    <p>
      I used <span class="medium">basic geometric forms</span> and <span class="medium">even-width strokes</span> that
      eliminate any type of
      contrast. Lowercase letters like
      the ‘a’
      are the exception when it comes to the even width.
    </p>

    <p class="light-italic">
      I made ascenders and descenders in the lowercase letters go over the height of uppercase characters.
    </p>

    <p class="medium">
      This makes the font look elegant and sets it apart from other geometric fonts.
    </p>

    <p class="medium">
      It was rather successful.
